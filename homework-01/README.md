## Homework 1
You'll be familiarizing yourself with *Solidity*, the currently most supported smart contract language. For those familiar with JavaScript, *Solidity* comes with a similar syntax.

## Homework Instructions

For the two exercises, **ex1** and **ex2**, please take a look at the specifications noted in their respective markdowns.

* In **greeter_skeleton.sol** you will be coding up the *Solidity* equivalent to `Hello, world!`. 
* In **fibonacci_skeleton.sol** you will be implementing the simple Fibonacci formula learned in CS61A.

For syntactical quirks and more info on the language, please refer to the [*Solidity* documentation](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

As you (probably) do not have your developer environment set up, we recommend checking your code in the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/). Using `Deploy` plugin, it should bring up fields where users can input arguments to specific functions. Clicking on that function's name should run the function and provide an output on console and below function button.
